# Get-PRNG
A chrome extension to extract the javascript pseudorandom number generator from any url.

This is a chrome extension that will attempt to return the prng function used by Javascript's Math.random for any website.  Once the prng is returned, the extensions popup will provide an interface such that you can calculate the exact random value as the website would at any given time.  The interface povides an optional time input so that future random values can be calculated.  

I just started this project, so it's new and far from perfect working condition.
